# Voyage I: Federation from Day One

Welcome to FlyBy, the companion app of Odyssey Voyage I! You can find the [course lessons and instructions in Odyssey](https://odyssey.apollographql.com/federation-part1/), Apollo's learning platform.

You can [preview the completed demo app here](https://odyssey-flyby.netlify.app/).

## How to use this repo

The course will walk you step by step through how to implement the features you see in the demo app. This codebase is the starting point of your journey!

### Backend

You will work in three main folders:

- `gateway`
- `subgraph-locations`
- `subgraph-reviews`

The course will help you set up and run each of these servers.

### Frontend

The repo also includes a `client` folder, which includes the frontend for the FlyBy app. You won't need to edit the code in this directory.

To run the client:

1. Open a new terminal window, and navigate to the `client` folder.
1. Run `npm install & npm start`. This will install all packages in the client and start the application in `localhost:3000`.
